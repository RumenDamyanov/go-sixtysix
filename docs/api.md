| declare | {suit:int} | Marriage (K+Q) at start of trick only |

## Versioning

Each action increments `session.version`. Clients should treat the response as canonical state.

## Errors

Returned as HTTP 400 with JSON body `{ "error": "message" }` for validation issues.

## Determinism

Supplying the same seed yields identical initial hands and trump.
